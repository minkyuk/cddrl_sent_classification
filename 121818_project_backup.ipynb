The American consumer stands to gain absolutely nothing by supporting this proposal. It is anti-neutrality, anti-free market, and anti-consumer. It does not promote the rights of consumers, it gives telecom companies to ability to unfairly crush competition whilst shafting their customers in the process.

The internet providers should be regulated in the same way that our telephone lines and our printed mediums are regulated -- with the idea that our freedoms will never be infringed. These public utilities should continue to be overseen by the agency that will enforce the public interests and this includes protecting our freedom of speech and freedom of commerce. By removing the restrictions of net neutrality, internet providers will have free reign to censor competitors through price controls, to censor its own customers through exclusions of content and to censor the very idea of our freedom of speech through their own actions.\\n\\nInternet providers have already put these ideas into practice through actions that are similar in nature to these. They have lobbied governments to restrict community-based internet, they have required Netflix and other content providers to pay higher prices for internet access, they have redirected domain lookup results to their own websites, they have implemented the idea of \"bandwidth caps\" and they have stated that they intend to do more than this.\\n\\nThe internet is a required utility for any 21st century business.

      "{'text': 'The market for internet service is unique in that it is foundational for the proper functioning of a plethora of markets that utilize the internet either directly or indirectly. Fair competition in these related markets is predicated upon the fairness and openness of the internet service market.\\n\\nAt the core of this issue is the fairness of markets that rely on the internet.\\n\\nTitle II, Section 202(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, states that \"it shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly or indirectly, by any means or device, or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of persons, or locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.\"\\n\\nMany in favor of Title II classification argue that this restriction creates a \"level playing field\" of competition for a number of markets that require internet service for transaction or communication. Re-classifying internet service providers under Title I would remove this important distinction and potentially create market imbalances that harm firms and consumers.\\n\\nThose in favor of Title I classification argue that market forces and competition would, likewise, create a \"level playing field\" and guarantee equal competitive footing for markets that require internet service. If this is true, then market forces would create a level playing field without undue regulatory intervention. If this is not true, then Title I classification creates unbalanced markets and limits competition in markets that utilize internet services, there may be significant negative repercussions those markets that may harm both consumers and firms.\\n\\nDue to the significant repercussions of uncompetitive markets, there should be a substantially high burden of proof placed on the argument that Title I classification will not result in anti-competitive markets. Sufficient proof has not been furnished. Therefore, internet service providers should remain classified under Title II, which explicitly restricts price or service discrimination.\\n\\nTo summarize, reclassifying internet service providers under Title I could potentially allow price or service discrimination among firms or individuals. This discrimination may create anti-competitive environments in a number of markets that utilize internet services.  While this may or may not happen, the economic and social costs of losing market competition is severe enough to warrant substantial proof that market competition will remain intact.  As such, a switch to Title I and the allowance of price or service discrimination should not be allowed unless there has been sufficient proof that there will be little or no adverse changes in competitive markets that utilize the internet. Sufficient proof has not been furnished. Therefore, internet service providers should remain under Title II classification.', 'count': 19}\n",

Cable companies (and wireless carriers) are actively lobbying Congress and the FCC for the power to:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Block sites and apps, to charge them \"access fees\"\\r\\n* Slow sites and apps to a crawl, to establish paid \"fast lanes\" (normal speed) and slow lanes (artificially low speeds)\\r\\n* Impose arbitrarily low data caps, so they can charge sites to escape those caps, or privilege their own services (\"zero rating\")\\r\\n\\r\\nThey\\'re doing it so they can use their monopoly power to stand between me and the sites I want to access, extorting money from us both. I\\'ll be forced to pay more to access the sites I want, and sites will have to pay a kind of protection money to every major cable company or wireless carrier—just to continue working properly! The FCC\\'s Open Internet Rules are the only thing standing in their way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m sending this to letter to my two senators, my representative, the White House, and the FCC. First, to the FCC: don’t interfere with my ability to access what I want on the Internet, or with websites\\' ability to reach me. You should leave the existing rules in place, and enforce them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my senators: you have the power to stop FCC Chair Ajit Pai from abusing the rules by refusing to vote for his reconfirmation. I expect you to use that power. Pai, a former Verizon employee, has made it clear he intends to gut the rules to please his former employer and other major carriers, despite overwhelming support for the rules from voters in both parties. I urge you publicly oppose Pai\\'s confirmation on these grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the White House: Ajit Pai, a former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former employer, not the American people. America deserves better. Appoint an FCC Chair who will protect the economic miracle that is the Internet from media monopolies like AT&T, Time Warner Cable, and Comcast/NBC/Universal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my representative: please publicly oppose Ajit Pai\\'s plan to oppose the rules, and do everything you can to persuade the Senate and the White House to oppose Pai\\'s nomination. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would be happy to speak more with anyone on your staff about the rules and why they’re so important to me.

Because companies like Comcast are not required to operate as utilities, it is immensely difficult to compete effectively, allowing the marketplace to be dominated by these companies. \\n\\nCompounding this is the Net Neutrality issue.

Companies like Comcast will use this to push subscribers to their own products, which will not count against their cap. Pay for Hulu, owned partly by NBC/Comcast, and it won't count against your cap. Use Xfinity home automation and it won't count. This is wrong. We live in a connected world, and this growing Balkanization of the web is going to result in a plummet in innovation online.

The ability of internet service providers to choose\\nwinners and losers would directly inhibit the ability of new businesses to reach a customer base on\\nequal footing with incumbent providers and large content providers. All businesses should be able to\\ncompete with incumbents on the innovation and quality of the services provided, not on their ability to\\npay incumbents to be on equal footing. The title of the rule is deceptive, as passage would limit the\\nfreedom of consumers to select the best products and services to meet their needs, and instead take\\naway that freedom and hand it to a limited number of incumbent internet providers.\\nThe Restoring Internet Freedom Rule does not meet any of FCC’s stated strategic goals. It would not\\npromote economic growth and national leadership, but would instead limit the opportunities for\\ninnovation and stifle industry-changing developments. The Rule would not protect public interest goals,\\nas it would result in higher prices and limited choices for consumers. The Restoring Internet Freedom\\nRule would not make networks work for everyone, but would instead consolidate control of the internet\\nto a few powerful companies. This Rule would also not promote operational excellence for the FCC, as\\nthe public has already shown great support for net neutrality rules, and this Rule and rule making\\nprocess is counter to the already spoken will of the people.\\nI urge you to maintain the current net neutrality rules and do not allow the Restoring Internet Freedom\\nRule to go into effect', 'count': 10}\n",

      "{'text': 'With respect, Mr. Chairman,\\nAs an American citizen who uses the Internet every day for business and social interactions and whose livelihood depends upon the connectedness the Internet provides,\\nI am alarmed by the manner in which our current business climate considers the Internet, and I am dismayed that our own FCC appears to lack the vision to recognize just how vital the Internet is and will be in the future of all human endeavors, including any conducted by U.S. academic, military, cultural, and corporate interests.\\nSimply put: the interconnected global network of data, business, and culture known as \"the Internet\" is the greatest human achievement in history WITHOUT QUESTION. It is axiomatic that the real world value of the Net exceeds the business interests of the American people or even the entire human global business output by many orders of magnitude.\\nTHIS is the framework our respected leaders should be considering these issues within. However, let\\'s set all that aside for a moment and focus on the issue being debated here.\\nWithin the American system and the economic reality of our current global position in control of the system itself, U.S. citizens certainly understand that the companies that invested and built the system (with the assistance of our taxes in the form of subsidies, grants, and other investments) need to be fairly compensated and furthermore nurtured and shielded from outside exploitation, and that these businesses must remain robust and vibrant far into the future.\\nWhich is exactly why I must advise and insist that these very companies be kept from destroying from WITHIN the very system they themselves created and grew, through their own foolish short-sightedness.\\nNet Neutrality is a core principle of ensuring the Internet remains an open system, and that open system is a safeguard against exploitation by malevolent actors, whether we are discussing competition in the marketplace or competition in the marketplace of ideas.\\nFurthermore, it is a Nation Security Imperative that the Internet remain free from increased economic exploitation by foreign powers implementing counter intelligence operations by weaponizing the framework itself and creating a new threat vector: paid accessibility to information.\\nAbandoning Net Neutrality will end in a balkanized Internet that no longer serves the interests of American citizens or American shareholders and hampers the already strained efforts of U.S. intelligence agencies\\' ability to conduct operations and establish defenses against intrusion and targeting by state and stateless foreign enemies.\\nIt is of paramount importance that the current regulatory framework not only REMAIN, but that Title II be strengthened and that new funding be dedicated to the FCC to carry out regulatory enforcement. Title II is currently our best option for continuing stability in this global network that fuels the global economy. Net Neutrality is common sense and vital to U.S. interests. Any attempts in the current climate to revisit this issue or to undermine the United States commitment to an Open Internet are not only against common sense but actually do injury to America\\'s reputation as an upstanding, responsible, and intelligent nation of rational governance, which has a real world impact in real world dollars lost.\\nMr. Chairman, the Internet is of vital strategic interest to the entire planet and the regulation of it requires grit, stamina, and incredible foresight. Please exercise these aspects of yourself when considering Net Neutrality and have the fortitude to stand with common sense and the interests of the American people.', 'count': 10}\n",

A telecom can not in one hand give low income subsidies viewing their services as a lifeline service such as electricity/gas and in the same hand sell it as a premium service to have the customrt experience molded by the highest bidder. We've already seen this atrocity with Comcast and Netflix as well as many cellphone service providers denying access to Google wallet to promote a premium service. Telecoms should stay as Title II in order to ensure that consumers have options when using their providers, not just whoever spent the most to present their content as the best experience if not the only option in some cases. Also there is no end game with this idiotic plan for Telecoms to reign over content delivery. Media companies spent millions to sue grade school kids for downloading MP3s.

We have that in common.\\n\\n  \\nDo we?\\n\\n  \\nBees have 100 percent employment,\\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s just what\\nI was thinking about doing.\\n\\n  \\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m going to drain the old stinger.\\n\\n  \\nYeah, you do that.\\n\\n  \\nLook at that.\\n\\n  \\nYou know, I\\'ve just about had it\\n\\n  \\nwith your little mind games.\\n\\n  \\n- What\\'s that?\\n- Italian Vogue.\\n\\n  \\nMamma mia, that\\'s a lot of pages.\\n\\n  \\nA lot of ads.\\n\\n  \\nRemember what Van said, why is\\nyour life more valuable than mine?\\n\\n  \\nFunny, I just can\\'t seem to recall that!\\n\\n  \\nI think something stinks in here!\\n\\n  \\nI love the smell of flowers.\\n\\n  \\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\\n\\n  \\nNot as much.\\n\\n  \\nWater bug!

What are you talking about?!\\nAre there other bugs in your life?\\n\\n  \\nNo, but there are other things bugging\\nme in life. And you\\'re one of them!\\n\\n  \\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\\n\\n  \\nMy nerves are fried from riding\\non this emotional roller coaster!\\n\\n  \\nGoodbye, Ken.\\n\\n  \\nAnd for your information,\\n\\n  \\nI prefer sugar-free, artificial\\nsweeteners made by man!\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m sorry about all that.\\n\\n  \\nI know it\\'s got\\nan aftertaste! I like it!\\n\\n  \\nI always felt there was some kind\\nof barrier between Ken and me.\\n\\n  \\nI couldn\\'t overcome it.\\nOh, well.\\n\\n  \\nAre you OK for the trial?\\n\\n  \\nI believe Mr. Montgomery\\nis about out of ideas.\\n\\n  \\nWe would like to call\\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\\n\\n  \\nGood idea! You can really see why he\\'s\\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\\n\\n  \\nYeah.\\n\\n  \\nLayton, you\\'ve\\ngotta weave some magic\\n\\n  \\nwith this jury,\\nor it\\'s gonna be all over.\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t worry. The only thing I have\\nto do to turn this jury around\\n\\n  \\nis to remind them\\nof what they don\\'t like about bees.\\n\\n  \\n- You got the tweezers?\\n- Are you allergic?\\n\\n  \\nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\\n\\n  \\nMr. Benson Bee, I\\'ll ask you\\nwhat I think we\\'d all like to know.\\n\\n  \\nWhat exactly is your relationship\\n\\n  \\nto that woman?\\n\\n  \\nWe\\'re friends.\\n\\n  \\n- Good friends?\\n- Yes.\\n\\n  \\nHow good?

What matters is\\nyou\\'re alive. You could have died.\\n\\n  \\nI\\'d be better off dead. Look at me.\\n\\n  \\nThey got it from the cafeteria\\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\\n\\n  \\nLook, there\\'s\\na little celery still on it.\\n\\n  \\nWhat was it like to sting someone?\\n\\n  \\nI can\\'t explain it. It was all...\\n\\n  \\nAll adrenaline and then...\\nand then ecstasy!\\n\\n  \\nAll right.\\n\\n  \\nYou think it was all a trap?\\n\\n  \\nOf course. I\\'m sorry.\\nI flew us right into this.\\n\\n  \\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us.

      "{'text': 'A free and open internet is a vital learning, business, and entertainment tool for the entire world. It has become a necessary part of the life of almost every American citizen whether they realize it or not. To roll back any net neutrality rules and alter the way that people are able to use the internet by prioritizing speeds or access to websites threatens all things that make the internet such an important part of our lives. If the FCC alters the internet in such a way to reverse protection on net neutrality as they stand now, it sends a clear and distinct message that the FCC values the profits of ISPs and other corporations that stand to benefit substantially by restricting access to the internet over protecting the people the FCC was created to represent and protect. The FCC should be doing everything in its power to protect the people of the United States, and I fear any rollbacks or changes to internet freedom and net neutrality as they stand now will be detrimental. As one last thought, creating this facade by calling a proceeding to roll back net neutrality the \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" is a pathetic attempt to shield what a proceeding like this would actually do: kill internet competition and destroy a vital part of what makes the internet so great. There is no sense of \"Freedom\" about this.', 'count': 8}\n",
      "{'text': \"It's my understanding that the FCC Chairman intends to reverse net neutrality rules. I am firmly against this action. I believe that internet service providers will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of the American public. In the past ten years, broadband companies have demonstrated their disregard for the public good.  They have throttling internet traffic, placed arbitrary data caps on accounts, falsely advertised “unlimited” internet access, and given privileged treatment to companies they own. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.  It is vital to America that internet traffic be routed neutrally.\", 'count': 8}\n",

This hurts consumers and businesses large and small.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourts have made clear that if the FCC ends Title II classification, the FCC must let ISPs offer fast lanes to websites for a fee, and Chairman Pai has made clear that he intends to do just this.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if you let ISPs make some websites fast and others artificially slow—for a fee—you will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the 5 most valuable companies in America—just to further enrich a few much less valuable cable giants famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m sending this to the FCC\\'s open proceeding, but I worry that Chairman Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, has made his plans and will ignore me and millions of other Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I\\'m also sending this to my members of Congress.

Net neutrality rules are only as strong as their weakest link, and it’s incumbent on the FCC to ensure these interconnection points aren’t used to end-run the principles of an open Internet. Given the lack of competition among broadband providers, the FCC's decisions have prevented regulations that thwart local investment in new broadband infrastructure and have been an important step toward ensuring greater consumer choice.

As of right now the internet service providers are not competing as many places only have one broadband provider to choose from. I believe the best course of action is to split up these companies(Comcast, Spectrum, AT&T) and allow cities to create municipal broadband. Another solution other then splitting the companies up is to encourage them to compete in the same areas.

While I don't expect the average to understand (I work in the tech industry), that is the entire point of representative democracy - we elect senators and representatives to make important decisions on behalf of the people (who may or may not understand complex issues).  While removing net neutrality may put more money into the hands of the service providers and their investors, it will also have the very real effect of stifling education (through limits on access to information), economic growth and innovation (through the stifling of small, home-based businesses), and, perhaps most disconcertingly of all, public discourse. \\n\\nA free, fair, and just society can only exist when the right to free expression guaranteed to all - removing net neutrality rules removes (whether implicitly or explicitly) those guarantees is the digital world.  My right to use whatever social networking or messaging service I choose should be unabated – even those networks whose message I vehemently disagree with have the First Amendment right to freedom of expression and press.  Allowing a service provider to be the gate-keeper to these communities is deplorable.\\n\\nAs this is the information age, where digital skills and presence are required for most non-labor professions, removing these rules will also disproportionately affect low-income individuals, particularly those with children and/or working in a declining field.  Unraveling neutrality will stifle access to informational and education-based sites that have not, perhaps, been considered, such as YouTube, KhanAcademy, and Wikipedia, limiting the access to education and opportunity to advance themselves and produce more for society.  As information is power, you would effectively be committing this demographic to a life of cyclical poverty and unfulfillment.\\n\\nEven economic growth is driven by freedom in technology: the stock market is buoyed by tech stocks; new entrepreneurs start businesses from their homes over the internet (many also work from home over the internet); eCommerce (Amazon, etc.) is creating jobs, tax revenue, and growth year-over-year.  Allowing ISPs to control or alter bandwidth to an eCommerce site is the de facto death of that venture, ensuring that the company willing to pay the most to the provider will prevail.  Allowing an ISP to regulate traffic to a company’s VPN would effectively allow them to charge the company more for employee access (on top of already charging the employee for their service), again ensuring that the venture with the deepest pockets will dominate.\\n\\nI implore you: do the right thing.

In fact it should never be about money. A person\\'s value does not rest in money. Sure, it may seem like that to corporations, but ultimately if a high-paying customer gets pissed with their ISP, they will complain, and ultimately it is the customer\\'s voice that matters more than the number of dollars the person makes.\\n\\nIf companies tout this idea so loudly - the customer is always right! - then WHY does the government need to repeal laws that work in their favor? Repealing of those laws say, \"the customer\\'s voice is not as important as their worth in money\", which, if you ask companies what they think of the question, they will likely respond \"oh no the customer\\'s voice is far more important, regardless of what they pay.\"\\n\\nThe fact that those same corporations have the money to boss the government around to the point where they can lobby to get Net Neutrality thrown out of the judicial system shows how little we can trust that these people have their customer\\'s best interests in mind as people.

Any restriction, prioritization, or manipulation of internet traffic by providers that affects the availability of lawful content to consumers is a detriment to the people and a violation of our rights, not to mention an assault on the core ideals the internet was founded upon.  The fundamental responsibility of internet providers is simply to open a door - it’s up to each individual to decide where to go after that.  That freedom is what grew the internet into an essential part of our daily lives, and thus put billions of dollars into the pockets of service providers.  Net neutrality MUST be upheld if current broadband providers want to continue to prosper (which they have, even after the implementation of Title II - among the three big providers of Comcast, AT&T and Verizon there\\'s been a net $3 billion increase in capex spending from 2014 to 2016, not the $3.6 billion decrease Chairman Pai claims).  The 2015 Open Internet rules reflect a history of net neutrality and provide concrete protections to ensure an open internet for the future.
