The American consumer stands to gain absolutely nothing by supporting this proposal. It is anti-neutrality, anti-free market, and anti-consumer. It does not promote the rights of consumers, it gives telecom companies to ability to unfairly crush competition whilst shafting their customers in the process.

The internet providers should be regulated in the same way that our telephone lines and our printed mediums are regulated -- with the idea that our freedoms will never be infringed. These public utilities should continue to be overseen by the agency that will enforce the public interests and this includes protecting our freedom of speech and freedom of commerce. By removing the restrictions of net neutrality, internet providers will have free reign to censor competitors through price controls, to censor its own customers through exclusions of content and to censor the very idea of our freedom of speech through their own actions.\\n\\nInternet providers have already put these ideas into practice through actions that are similar in nature to these. They have lobbied governments to restrict community-based internet, they have required Netflix and other content providers to pay higher prices for internet access, they have redirected domain lookup results to their own websites, they have implemented the idea of \"bandwidth caps\" and they have stated that they intend to do more than this.\\n\\nThe internet is a required utility for any 21st century business. The very notion that a new startup -- such as Sears -- could operate solely by mail-order would be laughable today.

The American consumer stands to gain absolutely nothing by supporting this proposal. It is anti-neutrality, anti-free market, and anti-consumer. It does not promote the rights of consumers, it gives telecom companies the ability to unfairly crush competition whilst shafting their customers in the process.

Fair competition in these related markets is predicated upon the fairness and openness of the internet service market.\\n\\nAt the core of this issue is the fairness of markets that rely on the internet.\\n\\nTitle II, Section 202(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, states that \"it shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly or indirectly, by any means or device, or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of persons, or locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.\"\\n\\nMany in favor of Title II classification argue that this restriction creates a \"level playing field\" of competition for a number of markets that require internet service for transaction or communication. Re-classifying internet service providers under Title I would remove this important distinction and potentially create market imbalances that harm firms and consumers.\\n\\nThose in favor of Title I classification argue that market forces and competition would, likewise, create a \"level playing field\" and guarantee equal competitive footing for markets that require internet service. If this is true, then market forces would create a level playing field without undue regulatory intervention. If this is not true, then Title I classification creates unbalanced markets and limits competition in markets that utilize internet services, there may be significant negative repercussions those markets that may harm both consumers and firms.\\n\\nDue to the significant repercussions of uncompetitive markets, there should be a substantially high burden of proof placed on the argument that Title I classification will not result in anti-competitive markets. Sufficient proof has not been furnished. Therefore, internet service providers should remain classified under Title II, which explicitly restricts price or service discrimination.\\n\\nTo summarize, reclassifying internet service providers under Title I could potentially allow price or service discrimination among firms or individuals. This discrimination may create anti-competitive environments in a number of markets that utilize internet services.  While this may or may not happen, the economic and social costs of losing market competition is severe enough to warrant substantial proof that market competition will remain intact.  As such, a switch to Title I and the allowance of price or service discrimination should not be allowed unless there has been sufficient proof that there will be little or no adverse changes in competitive markets that utilize the internet. Sufficient proof has not been furnished. Therefore, internet service providers should remain under Title II classification.', 'count': 19}\n",

Now is not the time (and there will never be a time) to let giant ISPs censor what we see and do online. Censorship by ISPs is a serious problem. Comcast has throttled Netflix, AT&T blocked FaceTime, Time Warner Cable throttled the popular game League of Legends, and Verizon admitted it will introduce fast lanes for sites that pay—and slow lanes for everyone else—if the FCC lifts the rules. This hurts consumers and businesses large and small. Courts have made clear that if the FCC ends Title II classification, the FCC must let ISPs offer fast lanes to websites for a fee, and Chairman Pai has made clear that he intends to do just this. But if you let ISPs make some websites fast and others artificially slow—for a fee—you will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the 5 most valuable companies in America—just to further enrich a few much less valuable cable giants famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.

Considering that many of the internet companies are becoming Oligopolies due to mergers, this could potentially harm the free market by allowing these Oligopolies to set prices instead of what the consumer would pay via Supply and Demand. By keeping Internet service equal and neutral, we can ensure the market remains stable and that people aren't given poor service at high prices because we can switch to a better service.\", 'count': 14}\n",

For 40 dollars a month, I receive 100mbps, while other markets have 70-80 dollar options for 1000mbps, an order of magnitude faster for only twice the cost. Because companies like Comcast are not required to operate as utilities, it is immensely difficult to compete effectively, allowing the marketplace to be dominated by these companies. \\n\\nCompounding this is the Net Neutrality issue. Comcast currently imposes a data cap on subscribers in my area of 1TB per month. While this might seem reasonable now, the explosion of streaming services, 4K content, and the Internet of Things will all increase usage of the internet far beyond this limit. Companies like Comcast will use this to push subscribers to their own products, which will not count against their cap. Pay for Hulu, owned partly by NBC/Comcast, and it won't count against your cap. Use Xfinity home automation and it won't count. This is wrong. We live in a connected world, and this growing Balkanization of the web is going to result in a plummet in innovation online. YouTube never would have existed if there were data caps, since users would blow through the cap. Nor would Netflix, which is an active and vigorous critic of Comcast and other ISPs anti net neutrality behavior. The companies on the web are the companies that deserve any consideration.

The ability of internet service providers to choose\\nwinners and losers would directly inhibit the ability of new businesses to reach a customer base on\\nequal footing with incumbent providers and large content providers. All businesses should be able to\\ncompete with incumbents on the innovation and quality of the services provided, not on their ability to\\npay incumbents to be on equal footing. The title of the rule is deceptive, as passage would limit the\\nfreedom of consumers to select the best products and services to meet their needs, and instead take\\naway that freedom and hand it to a limited number of incumbent internet providers.\\nThe Restoring Internet Freedom Rule does not meet any of FCC’s stated strategic goals. It would not\\npromote economic growth and national leadership, but would instead limit the opportunities for\\ninnovation and stifle industry-changing developments. The Rule would not protect public interest goals,\\nas it would result in higher prices and limited choices for consumers. The Restoring Internet Freedom\\nRule would not make networks work for everyone, but would instead consolidate control of the internet\\nto a few powerful companies. This Rule would also not promote operational excellence for the FCC, as\\nthe public has already shown great support for net neutrality rules, and this Rule and rule making\\nprocess is counter to the already spoken will of the people.\\nI urge you to maintain the current net neutrality rules and do not allow the Restoring Internet Freedom\\nRule to go into effect', 'count': 10}\n",

      "{'text': 'With respect, Mr. Chairman,\\nAs an American citizen who uses the Internet every day for business and social interactions and whose livelihood depends upon the connectedness the Internet provides,\\nI am alarmed by the manner in which our current business climate considers the Internet, and I am dismayed that our own FCC appears to lack the vision to recognize just how vital the Internet is and will be in the future of all human endeavors, including any conducted by U.S. academic, military, cultural, and corporate interests.\\nSimply put: the interconnected global network of data, business, and culture known as \"the Internet\" is the greatest human achievement in history WITHOUT QUESTION. It is axiomatic that the real world value of the Net exceeds the business interests of the American people or even the entire human global business output by many orders of magnitude.\\nTHIS is the framework our respected leaders should be considering these issues within. However, let\\'s set all that aside for a moment and focus on the issue being debated here.\\nWithin the American system and the economic reality of our current global position in control of the system itself, U.S. citizens certainly understand that the companies that invested and built the system (with the assistance of our taxes in the form of subsidies, grants, and other investments) need to be fairly compensated and furthermore nurtured and shielded from outside exploitation, and that these businesses must remain robust and vibrant far into the future.\\nWhich is exactly why I must advise and insist that these very companies be kept from destroying from WITHIN the very system they themselves created and grew, through their own foolish short-sightedness.\\nNet Neutrality is a core principle of ensuring the Internet remains an open system, and that open system is a safeguard against exploitation by malevolent actors, whether we are discussing competition in the marketplace or competition in the marketplace of ideas.\\nFurthermore, it is a Nation Security Imperative that the Internet remain free from increased economic exploitation by foreign powers implementing counter intelligence operations by weaponizing the framework itself and creating a new threat vector: paid accessibility to information.\\nAbandoning Net Neutrality will end in a balkanized Internet that no longer serves the interests of American citizens or American shareholders and hampers the already strained efforts of U.S. intelligence agencies\\' ability to conduct operations and establish defenses against intrusion and targeting by state and stateless foreign enemies.\\nIt is of paramount importance that the current regulatory framework not only REMAIN, but that Title II be strengthened and that new funding be dedicated to the FCC to carry out regulatory enforcement. Title II is currently our best option for continuing stability in this global network that fuels the global economy. Net Neutrality is common sense and vital to U.S. interests. Any attempts in the current climate to revisit this issue or to undermine the United States commitment to an Open Internet are not only against common sense but actually do injury to America\\'s reputation as an upstanding, responsible, and intelligent nation of rational governance, which has a real world impact in real world dollars lost.\\nMr. Chairman, the Internet is of vital strategic interest to the entire planet and the regulation of it requires grit, stamina, and incredible foresight. Please exercise these aspects of yourself when considering Net Neutrality and have the fortitude to stand with common sense and the interests of the American people.', 'count': 10}\n",

Net neutrality in its current form is beneficial to consumers. Telecoms have shown that they have interest in making money from preferred content and services. A telecom can not in one hand give low income subsidies viewing their services as a lifeline service such as electricity/gas and in the same hand sell it as a premium service to have the customrt experience molded by the highest bidder. We've already seen this atrocity with Comcast and Netflix as well as many cellphone service providers denying access to Google wallet to promote a premium service. Telecoms should stay as Title II in order to ensure that consumers have options when using their providers, not just whoever spent the most to present their content as the best experience if not the only option in some cases. Also there is no end game with this idiotic plan for Telecoms to reign over content delivery. Media companies spent millions to sue grade school kids for downloading MP3s. Telecoms may think Media company coffers are ripe for the squeezing, but they are literally as savage as game of thrones. They'll fight you to the ends of the Earth.\", 'count': 10}\n",

Yes, Your Honor,\\nwe\\'re ready to proceed.\\n\\n  \\nMr. Montgomery,\\nyour opening statement, please.\\n\\n  \\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\\n\\n  \\nmy grandmother was a simple woman.\\n\\n  \\nBorn on a farm, she believed\\nit was man\\'s divine right\\n\\n  \\nto benefit from the bounty\\nof nature God put before us.\\n\\n  \\nIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world\\nMr. Benson imagines,\\n\\n  \\njust think of what would it mean.\\n\\n  \\nI would have to negotiate\\nwith the silkworm\\n\\n  \\nfor the elastic in my britches!\\n\\n  \\nTalking bee!\\n\\n  \\nHow do we know this isn\\'t some sort of\\n\\n  \\nholographic motion-picture-capture\\nHollywood wizardry?\\n\\n  \\nThey could be using laser beams!\\n\\n  \\nRobotics! Ventriloquism!\\nOloning! For all we know,\\n\\n  \\nhe could be on steroids!\\n\\n  \\nMr. Benson?\\n\\n  \\nLadies and gentlemen,\\nthere\\'s no trickery here.\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m just an ordinary bee.\\nHoney\\'s pretty important to me.\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s important to all bees.\\nWe invented it!\\n\\n  \\nWe make it. And we protect it\\nwith our lives.\\n\\n  \\nUnfortunately, there are\\nsome people in this room\\n\\n  \\nwho think they can take it from us\\n\\n  \\n\\'cause we\\'re the little guys!\\nI\\'m hoping that, after this is all over,\\n\\n  \\nyou\\'ll see how, by taking our honey,\\nyou not only take everything we have\\n\\n  \\nbut everything we are!\\n\\n  \\nI wish he\\'d dress like that\\nall the time. So nice!\\n\\n  \\nOall your first witness.\\n\\n  \\nSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\\nof Honey Farms, big company you have.\\n\\n  \\nI suppose so.\\n\\n  \\nI see you also own\\nHoneyburton and Honron!\\n\\n  \\nYes, they provide beekeepers\\nfor our farms.\\n\\n  \\nBeekeeper. I find that\\nto be a very disturbing term.\\n\\n  \\nI don\\'t imagine you employ\\nany bee-free-ers, do you?\\n\\n  \\n- No.\\n- I couldn\\'t hear you.\\n\\n  \\n- No.\\n- No.\\n\\n  \\nBecause you don\\'t free bees.\\nYou keep bees. Not only that,\\n\\n  \\nit seems you thought a bear would be\\nan appropriate image for a jar of honey.\\n\\n  \\nThey\\'re very lovable creatures.\\n\\n  \\nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\\n\\n  \\nYou mean like this?\\n\\n  \\nBears kill bees!\\n\\n  \\nHow\\'d you like his head crashing\\nthrough your living room?!\\n\\n  \\nBiting into your couch!\\nSpitting out your throw pillows!\\n\\n  \\nOK, that\\'s enough. Take him away.\\n\\n  \\nSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\\nYour name intrigues me.\\n\\n  \\n- Where have I heard it before?\\n- I was with a band called The Police.\\n\\n  \\nBut you\\'ve never been\\na police officer, have you?\\n\\n  \\nNo, I haven\\'t.\\n\\n  \\nNo, you haven\\'t. And so here\\nwe have yet another example\\n\\n  \\nof bee culture casually\\nstolen by a human\\n\\n  \\nfor nothing more than\\na prance-about stage name.\\n\\n  \\nOh, please.\\n\\n  \\nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\\n\\n  \\nBecause I\\'m feeling\\na little stung, Sting.\\n\\n  \\nOr should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s not his real name?! You idiots!\\n\\n  \\nMr. Liotta, first,\\nbelated congratulations on\\n\\n  \\nyour Emmy win for a guest spot\\non ER in 2005.\\n\\n  \\nThank you. Thank you.\\n\\n  \\nI see from your resume\\nthat you\\'re devilishly handsome\\n\\n  \\nwith a churning inner turmoil\\nthat\\'s ready to blow.\\n\\n  \\nI enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\\n\\n  \\nNot yet it isn\\'t. But is this\\nwhat it\\'s come to for you?\\n\\n  \\nExploiting tiny, helpless bees\\nso you don\\'t\\n\\n  \\nhave to rehearse\\nyour part and learn your lines, sir?\\n\\n  \\nWatch it, Benson!\\nI could blow right now!\\n\\n  \\nThis isn\\'t a goodfella.\\nThis is a badfella!\\n\\n  \\nWhy doesn\\'t someone just step on\\nthis creep, and we can all go home?!\\n\\n  \\n- Order in this court!\\n- You\\'re all thinking it!\\n\\n  \\nOrder! Order, I say!\\n\\n  \\n- Say it!\\n- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\\n\\n  \\nI think it was awfully nice\\nof that bear to pitch in like that.\\n\\n  \\nI think the jury\\'s on our side.\\n\\n  \\nAre we doing everything right, legally?\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m a florist.\\n\\n  \\nRight. Well, here\\'s to a great team.\\n\\n  \\nTo a great team!\\n\\n  \\nWell, hello.\\n\\n  \\n- Ken!\\n- Hello.\\n\\n  \\nI didn\\'t think you were coming.\\n\\n  \\nNo, I was just late.\\nI tried to call, but... the battery.\\n\\n  \\nI didn\\'t want all this to go to waste,\\nso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\\n\\n  \\nOh, that was lucky.\\n\\n  \\nThere\\'s a little left.\\nI could heat it up.\\n\\n  \\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\\n\\n  \\nSo I hear you\\'re quite a tennis player.\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m not much for the game myself.\\nThe ball\\'s a little grabby.\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s where I usually sit.\\nRight... there.\\n\\n  \\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\\n\\n  \\nand he agreed with me that eating with\\nchopsticks isn\\'t really a special skill.\\n\\n  \\nYou think I don\\'t see what you\\'re doing?\\n\\n  \\nI know how hard it is to find\\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\\n\\n  \\nDo we?\\n\\n  \\nBees have 100 percent employment,\\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s just what\\nI was thinking about doing.\\n\\n  \\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m going to drain the old stinger.\\n\\n  \\nYeah, you do that.\\n\\n  \\nLook at that.\\n\\n  \\nYou know, I\\'ve just about had it\\n\\n  \\nwith your little mind games.\\n\\n  \\n- What\\'s that?\\n- Italian Vogue.\\n\\n  \\nMamma mia, that\\'s a lot of pages.\\n\\n  \\nA lot of ads.\\n\\n  \\nRemember what Van said, why is\\nyour life more valuable than mine?\\n\\n  \\nFunny, I just can\\'t seem to recall that!\\n\\n  \\nI think something stinks in here!\\n\\n  \\nI love the smell of flowers.\\n\\n  \\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\\n\\n  \\nNot as much.\\n\\n  \\nWater bug! Not taking sides!\\n\\n  \\nKen, I\\'m wearing a Ohapstick hat!\\nThis is pathetic!\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve got issues!\\n\\n  \\nWell, well, well, a royal flush!\\n\\n  \\n- You\\'re bluffing.\\n- Am I?\\n\\n  \\nSurf\\'s up, dude!\\n\\n  \\nPoo water!\\n\\n  \\nThat bowl is gnarly.\\n\\n  \\nExcept for those dirty yellow rings!\\n\\n  \\nKenneth! What are you doing?!\\n\\n  \\nYou know, I don\\'t even like honey!\\nI don\\'t eat it!\\n\\n  \\nWe need to talk!\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s just a little bee!\\n\\n  \\nAnd he happens to be\\nthe nicest bee I\\'ve met in a long time!\\n\\n  \\nLong time? What are you talking about?!\\nAre there other bugs in your life?\\n\\n  \\nNo, but there are other things bugging\\nme in life. And you\\'re one of them!\\n\\n  \\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\\n\\n  \\nMy nerves are fried from riding\\non this emotional roller coaster!\\n\\n  \\nGoodbye, Ken.\\n\\n  \\nAnd for your information,\\n\\n  \\nI prefer sugar-free, artificial\\nsweeteners made by man!\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m sorry about all that.\\n\\n  \\nI know it\\'s got\\nan aftertaste! I like it!\\n\\n  \\nI always felt there was some kind\\nof barrier between Ken and me.\\n\\n  \\nI couldn\\'t overcome it.\\nOh, well.\\n\\n  \\nAre you OK for the trial?\\n\\n  \\nI believe Mr. Montgomery\\nis about out of ideas.\\n\\n  \\nWe would like to call\\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\\n\\n  \\nGood idea! You can really see why he\\'s\\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\\n\\n  \\nYeah.\\n\\n  \\nLayton, you\\'ve\\ngotta weave some magic\\n\\n  \\nwith this jury,\\nor it\\'s gonna be all over.\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t worry. The only thing I have\\nto do to turn this jury around\\n\\n  \\nis to remind them\\nof what they don\\'t like about bees.\\n\\n  \\n- You got the tweezers?\\n- Are you allergic?\\n\\n  \\nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\\n\\n  \\nMr. Benson Bee, I\\'ll ask you\\nwhat I think we\\'d all like to know.\\n\\n  \\nWhat exactly is your relationship\\n\\n  \\nto that woman?\\n\\n  \\nWe\\'re friends.\\n\\n  \\n- Good friends?\\n- Yes.\\n\\n  \\nHow good? Do you live together?\\n\\n  \\nWait a minute...\\n\\n  \\nAre you her little...\\n\\n  \\n...bedbug?\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve seen a bee documentary or two.\\nFrom what I understand,\\n\\n  \\ndoesn\\'t your queen give birth\\nto all the bee children?\\n\\n  \\n- Yeah, but...\\n- So those aren\\'t your real parents!\\n\\n  \\n- Oh, Barry...\\n- Yes, they are!\\n\\n  \\nHold me back!\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re an illegitimate bee,\\naren\\'t you, Benson?\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s denouncing bees!\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t y\\'all date your cousins?\\n\\n  \\n- Objection!\\n- I\\'m going to pincushion this guy!\\n\\n  \\nAdam, don\\'t! It\\'s what he wants!\\n\\n  \\nOh, I\\'m hit!!\\n\\n  \\nOh, lordy, I am hit!\\n\\n  \\nOrder! Order!\\n\\n  \\nThe venom! The venom\\nis coursing through my veins!\\n\\n  \\nI have been felled\\nby a winged beast of destruction!\\n\\n  \\nYou see? You can\\'t treat them\\nlike equals! They\\'re striped savages!\\n\\n  \\nStinging\\'s the only thing\\nthey know! It\\'s their way!\\n\\n  \\n- Adam, stay with me.\\n- I can\\'t feel my legs.\\n\\n  \\nWhat angel of mercy\\nwill come forward to suck the poison\\n\\n  \\nfrom my heaving buttocks?\\n\\n  \\nI will have order in this court. Order!\\n\\n  \\nOrder, please!\\n\\n  \\nThe case of the honeybees\\nversus the human race\\n\\n  \\ntook a pointed turn against the bees\\n\\n  \\nyesterday when one of their legal\\nteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.\\n\\n  \\n- Hey, buddy.\\n- Hey.\\n\\n  \\n- Is there much pain?\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n  \\nI...\\n\\n  \\nI blew the whole case, didn\\'t I?\\n\\n  \\nIt doesn\\'t matter. What matters is\\nyou\\'re alive. You could have died.\\n\\n  \\nI\\'d be better off dead. Look at me.\\n\\n  \\nThey got it from the cafeteria\\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\\n\\n  \\nLook, there\\'s\\na little celery still on it.\\n\\n  \\nWhat was it like to sting someone?\\n\\n  \\nI can\\'t explain it. It was all...\\n\\n  \\nAll adrenaline and then...\\nand then ecstasy!\\n\\n  \\nAll right.\\n\\n  \\nYou think it was all a trap?\\n\\n  \\nOf course. I\\'m sorry.\\nI flew us right into this.\\n\\n  \\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We\\'re\\njust a couple of bugs in this world.\\n\\n  \\nWhat will the humans do to us\\nif they win?\\n\\n  \\nI don\\'t know.\\n\\n  \\nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\\nThat doesn\\'t sound so bad.\\n\\n  \\nAdam, they check in,\\nbut they don\\'t check out!\\n\\n  \\nOh, my.\\n\\n  \\nOould you get a nurse\\nto close that window?\\n\\n  \\n- Why?\\n- The smoke.\\n\\n  \\nBees don\\'t smoke.\\n\\n  \\nRight. Bees don\\'t smoke.\\n\\n  \\nBees don\\'t smoke!\\nBut some bees are smoking.\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s it! That\\'s our case!\\n\\n  \\nIt is? It\\'s not over?\\n\\n  \\nGet dressed. I\\'ve gotta go somewhere.\\n\\n  \\nGet back to the court and stall.\\nStall any way you can.\\n\\n  \\nAnd assuming you\\'ve done step correctly, you\\'re ready for the tub.\\n\\n  \\nMr. Flayman.\\n\\n  \\nYes? Yes, Your Honor!\\n\\n  \\nWhere is the rest of your team?\\n\\n  \\nWell, Your Honor, it\\'s interesting.\\n\\n  \\nBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\\n\\n  \\nand as a result,\\nwe don\\'t make very good time.\\n\\n  \\nI actually heard a funny story about...\\n\\n  \\nYour Honor,\\nhaven\\'t these ridiculous bugs\\n\\n  \\ntaken up enough\\nof this court\\'s valuable time?\\n\\n  \\nHow much longer will we allow\\nthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\\n\\n  \\nThey have presented no compelling\\nevidence to support their charges\\n\\n  \\nagainst my clients,\\nwho run legitimate businesses.\\n\\n  \\nI move for a complete dismissal\\nof this entire case!\\n\\n  \\nMr. Flayman, I\\'m afraid I\\'m going\\n\\n  \\nto have to consider\\nMr. Montgomery\\'s motion.\\n\\n  \\nBut you can\\'t! We have a terrific case.\\n\\n  \\nWhere is your proof?\\nWhere is the evidence?\\n\\n  \\nShow me the smoking gun!\\n\\n  \\nHold it, Your Honor!\\nYou want a smoking gun?\\n\\n  \\nHere is your smoking gun.\\n\\n  \\nWhat is that?\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s a bee smoker!\\n\\n  \\nWhat, this?\\nThis harmless little contraption?\\n\\n  \\nThis couldn\\'t hurt a fly,\\nlet alone a bee.\\n\\n  \\nLook at what has happened\\n\\n  \\nto bees who have never been asked,\\n\"Smoking or non?\"\\n\\n  \\nIs this what nature intended for us?\\n\\n  \\nTo be forcibly addicted\\nto smoke machines\\n\\n  \\nand man-made wooden slat work camps?\\n\\n  \\nLiving out our lives as honey slaves\\nto the white man?\\n\\n  \\n- What are we gonna do?\\n- He\\'s playing the species card.\\n\\n  \\nLadies and gentlemen, please,\\nfree these bees!\\n\\n  \\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\\n\\n  \\nFree the bees!\\n\\n  \\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\\n\\n  \\nThe court finds in favor of the bees!\\n\\n  \\nVanessa, we won!\\n\\n  \\nI knew you could do it! High-five!\\n\\n  \\nSorry.\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m OK! You know what this means?\\n\\n  \\nAll the honey\\nwill finally belong to the bees.\\n\\n  \\nNow we won\\'t have\\nto work so hard all the time.\\n\\n  \\nThis is an unholy perversion\\nof the balance of nature, Benson.\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'ll regret this.\\n\\n  \\nBarry, how much honey is out there?\\n\\n  \\nAll right. One at a time.\\n\\n  \\nBarry, who are you wearing?\\n\\n  \\nMy sweater is Ralph Lauren,\\nand I have no pants.\\n\\n  \\n- What if Montgomery\\'s right?\\n- What do you mean?\\n\\n  \\nWe\\'ve been living the bee way\\na long time, 27 million years.\\n\\n  \\nOongratulations on your victory.\\nWhat will you demand as a settlement?\\n\\n  \\nFirst, we\\'ll demand a complete shutdown\\nof all bee work camps.\\n\\n  \\nThen we want back the honey\\nthat was ours to begin with,\\n\\n  \\nevery last drop.\\n\\n  \\nWe demand an end to the glorification\\nof the bear as anything more\\n\\n  \\nthan a filthy, smelly,\\nbad-breath stink machine.\\n\\n  \\nWe\\'re all aware\\nof what they do in the woods.\\n\\n  \\nWait for my signal.\\n\\n  \\nTake him out.\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'ll have nauseous\\nfor a few hours, then he\\'ll be fine.\\n\\n  \\nAnd we will no longer tolerate\\nbee-negative nicknames...\\n\\n  \\nBut it\\'s just a prance-about stage name!\\n\\n  \\n...unnecessary inclusion of honey\\nin bogus health products\\n\\n  \\nand la-dee-da human\\ntea-time snack garnishments.\\n\\n  \\nOan\\'t breathe.\\n\\n  \\nBring it in, boys!\\n\\n  \\nHold it right there! Good.\\n\\n  \\nTap it.\\n\\n  \\nMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,\\nand there\\'s gallons more coming!\\n\\n  \\n- I think we need to shut down!\\n- Shut down? We\\'ve never shut down.\\n\\n  \\nShut down honey production!\\n\\n  \\nStop making honey!\\n\\n  \\nTurn your key, sir!\\n\\n  \\nWhat do we do now?\\n\\n  \\nOannonball!\\n\\n  \\nWe\\'re shutting honey production!\\n\\n  \\nMission abort.\\n\\n  \\nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\\nReturning to base.\\n\\n  \\nAdam, you wouldn\\'t believe\\nhow much honey was out there.\\n\\n  \\nOh, yeah?\\n\\n  \\nWhat\\'s going on? Where is everybody?\\n\\n  \\n- Are they out celebrating?\\n- They\\'re home.\\n\\n  \\nThey don\\'t know what to do.\\nLaying out, sleeping in.\\n\\n  \\nI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way\\nto San Antonio with a cricket.\\n\\n  \\nAt least we got our honey back.\\n\\n  \\nSometimes I think, so what if humans\\nliked our honey? Who wouldn\\'t?\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s the greatest thing in the world!\\nI was excited to be part of making it.\\n\\n  \\nThis was my new desk. This was my\\nnew job. I wanted to do it really well.\\n\\n  \\nAnd now...\\n\\n  \\nNow I can\\'t.\\n\\n  \\nI don\\'t understand\\nwhy they\\'re not happy.\\n\\n  \\nI thought their lives would be better!\\n\\n  \\nThey\\'re doing nothing. It\\'s amazing.\\nHoney really changes people.\\n\\n  \\nYou don\\'t have any idea\\nwhat\\'s going on, do you?\\n\\n  \\n- What did you want to show me?\\n- This.\\n\\n  \\nWhat happened here?\\n\\n  \\nThat is not the half of it.\\n\\n  \\nOh, no. Oh, my.\\n\\n  \\nThey\\'re all wilting.\\n\\n  \\nDoesn\\'t look very good, does it?\\n\\n  \\nNo.\\n\\n  \\nAnd whose fault do you think that is?\\n\\n  \\nYou know, I\\'m gonna guess bees.\\n\\n  \\nBees?\\n\\n  \\nSpecifically, me.\\n\\n  \\nI didn\\'t think bees not needing to make\\nhoney would affect all these things.\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s notjust flowers.\\nFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s our whole SAT test right there.\\n\\n  \\nTake away produce, that affects\\nthe entire animal kingdom.\\n\\n  \\nAnd then, of course...\\n\\n  \\nThe human species?\\n\\n  \\nSo if there\\'s no more pollination,\\n\\n  \\nit could all just go south here,\\ncouldn\\'t it?\\n\\n  \\nI know this is also partly my fault.\\n\\n  \\nHow about a suicide pact?\\n\\n  \\nHow do we do it?\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'ll sting you, you step on me.\\n- Thatjust kills you twice.\\n\\n  \\nRight, right.\\n\\n  \\nListen, Barry...\\nsorry, but I gotta get going.\\n\\n  \\nI had to open my mouth and talk.\\n\\n  \\nVanessa?\\n\\n  \\nVanessa? Why are you leaving?\\nWhere are you going?\\n\\n  \\nTo the final Tournament of Roses parade\\nin Pasadena.\\n\\n  \\nThey\\'ve moved it to this weekend\\nbecause all the flowers are dying.\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s the last chance\\nI\\'ll ever have to see it.\\n\\n  \\nVanessa, I just wanna say I\\'m sorry.\\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\\n\\n  \\nI know. Me neither.\\n\\n  \\nTournament of Roses.\\nRoses can\\'t do sports.\\n\\n  \\nWait a minute. Roses. Roses?\\n\\n  \\nRoses!\\n\\n  \\nVanessa!\\n\\n  \\nRoses?!\\n\\n  \\nBarry?\\n\\n  \\n- Roses are flowers!\\n- Yes, they are.\\n\\n  \\nFlowers, bees, pollen!\\n\\n  \\nI know.\\nThat\\'s why this is the last parade.\\n\\n  \\nMaybe not.\\nOould you ask him to slow down?\\n\\n  \\nOould you slow down?\\n\\n  \\nBarry!\\n\\n  \\nOK, I made a huge mistake.\\nThis is a total disaster, all my fault.\\n\\n  \\nYes, it kind of is.\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve ruined the planet.\\nI wanted to help you\\n\\n  \\nwith the flower shop.\\nI\\'ve made it worse.\\n\\n  \\nActually, it\\'s completely closed down.\\n\\n  \\nI thought maybe you were remodeling.\\n\\n  \\nBut I have another idea, and it\\'s\\ngreater than my previous ideas combined.\\n\\n  \\nI don\\'t want to hear it!\\n\\n  \\nAll right, they have the roses,\\nthe roses have the pollen.\\n\\n  \\nI know every bee, plant\\nand flower bud in this park.\\n\\n  \\nAll we gotta do is get what they\\'ve got\\nback here with what we\\'ve got.\\n\\n  \\n- Bees.\\n- Park.\\n\\n  \\n- Pollen!\\n- Flowers.\\n\\n  \\n- Repollination!\\n- Across the nation!\\n\\n  \\nTournament of Roses,\\nPasadena, Oalifornia.\\n\\n  \\nThey\\'ve got nothing\\nbut flowers, floats and cotton candy.\\n\\n  \\nSecurity will be tight.\\n\\n  \\nI have an idea.\\n\\n  \\nVanessa Bloome, FTD.\\n\\n  \\nOfficial floral business. It\\'s real.\\n\\n  \\nSorry, ma\\'am. Nice brooch.\\n\\n  \\nThank you. It was a gift.\\n\\n  \\nOnce inside,\\nwe just pick the right float.\\n\\n  \\nHow about The Princess and the Pea?\\n\\n  \\nI could be the princess,\\nand you could be the pea!\\n\\n  \\nYes, I got it.\\n\\n  \\n- Where should I sit?\\n- What are you?\\n\\n  \\n- I believe I\\'m the pea.\\n- The pea?\\n\\n  \\nIt goes under the mattresses.\\n\\n  \\n- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\\n- I\\'m getting the marshal.\\n\\n  \\nYou do that!\\nThis whole parade is a fiasco!\\n\\n  \\nLet\\'s see what this baby\\'ll do.\\n\\n  \\nHey, what are you doing?!\\n\\n  \\nThen all we do\\nis blend in with traffic...\\n\\n  \\n...without arousing suspicion.\\n\\n  \\nOnce at the airport,\\nthere\\'s no stopping us.\\n\\n  \\nStop! Security.\\n\\n  \\n- You and your insect pack your float?\\n- Yes.\\n\\n  \\nHas it been\\nin your possession the entire time?\\n\\n  \\nWould you remove your shoes?\\n\\n  \\n- Remove your stinger.\\n- It\\'s part of me.\\n\\n  \\nI know. Just having some fun.\\nEnjoy your flight.\\n\\n  \\nThen if we\\'re lucky, we\\'ll have\\njust enough pollen to do the job.\\n\\n  \\nOan you believe how lucky we are? We\\nhave just enough pollen to do the job!\\n\\n  \\nI think this is gonna work.\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s got to work.\\n\\n  \\nAttention, passengers,\\nthis is Oaptain Scott.\\n\\n  \\nWe have a bit of bad weather\\nin New York.\\n\\n  \\nIt looks like we\\'ll experience\\na couple hours delay.\\n\\n  \\nBarry, these are cut flowers\\nwith no water.

      "{'text': 'A free and open internet is a vital learning, business, and entertainment tool for the entire world. It has become a necessary part of the life of almost every American citizen whether they realize it or not. To roll back any net neutrality rules and alter the way that people are able to use the internet by prioritizing speeds or access to websites threatens all things that make the internet such an important part of our lives. If the FCC alters the internet in such a way to reverse protection on net neutrality as they stand now, it sends a clear and distinct message that the FCC values the profits of ISPs and other corporations that stand to benefit substantially by restricting access to the internet over protecting the people the FCC was created to represent and protect. The FCC should be doing everything in its power to protect the people of the United States, and I fear any rollbacks or changes to internet freedom and net neutrality as they stand now will be detrimental. As one last thought, creating this facade by calling a proceeding to roll back net neutrality the \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" is a pathetic attempt to shield what a proceeding like this would actually do: kill internet competition and destroy a vital part of what makes the internet so great. There is no sense of \"Freedom\" about this.', 'count': 8}\n",
      "{'text': \"It's my understanding that the FCC Chairman intends to reverse net neutrality rules. I am firmly against this action. I believe that internet service providers will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of the American public. In the past ten years, broadband companies have demonstrated their disregard for the public good.  They have throttling internet traffic, placed arbitrary data caps on accounts, falsely advertised “unlimited” internet access, and given privileged treatment to companies they own. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.  It is vital to America that internet traffic be routed neutrally.\", 'count': 8}\n",

Today, I call on the FCC to uphold the decisions around net neutrality that it made in 2015: ISPs must continue to be regulated under Title II utility-style regulations to ensure that ISPs cannot shift bad conduct upstream to where they interconnect with content providers. Net neutrality rules are only as strong as their weakest link, and it’s incumbent on the FCC to ensure these interconnection points aren’t used to end-run the principles of an open Internet. Given the lack of competition among broadband providers, the FCC's decisions have prevented regulations that thwart local investment in new broadband infrastructure and have been an important step toward ensuring greater consumer choice. These actions have kicked off a new era that puts the consumer, not litigious corporate giants, at the center of competition policy. Do not roll back the progress we've already made.

As of right now the internet service providers are not competing as many places only have one broadband provider to choose from. I believe the best course of action is to split up these companies(Comcast, Spectrum, AT&T) and allow cities to create municipal broadband. Another solution other then splitting the companies up is to encourage them to compete in the same areas. I do not see a way to successfully encourage these companies to compete but it is a less messy solution then splitting the companies up if you can manage it successfully.\\n\\nEither way changing internet service providers to Title I will not help increase competition.

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules.

While I don't expect the average to understand (I work in the tech industry), that is the entire point of representative democracy - we elect senators and representatives to make important decisions on behalf of the people (who may or may not understand complex issues).  While removing net neutrality may put more money into the hands of the service providers and their investors, it will also have the very real effect of stifling education (through limits on access to information), economic growth and innovation (through the stifling of small, home-based businesses), and, perhaps most disconcertingly of all, public discourse. \\n\\nA free, fair, and just society can only exist when the right to free expression guaranteed to all - removing net neutrality rules removes (whether implicitly or explicitly) those guarantees is the digital world.  My right to use whatever social networking or messaging service I choose should be unabated – even those networks whose message I vehemently disagree with have the First Amendment right to freedom of expression and press.  Allowing a service provider to be the gate-keeper to these communities is deplorable.\\n\\nAs this is the information age, where digital skills and presence are required for most non-labor professions, removing these rules will also disproportionately affect low-income individuals, particularly those with children and/or working in a declining field.  Unraveling neutrality will stifle access to informational and education-based sites that have not, perhaps, been considered, such as YouTube, KhanAcademy, and Wikipedia, limiting the access to education and opportunity to advance themselves and produce more for society.  As information is power, you would effectively be committing this demographic to a life of cyclical poverty and unfulfillment.\\n\\nEven economic growth is driven by freedom in technology: the stock market is buoyed by tech stocks; new entrepreneurs start businesses from their homes over the internet (many also work from home over the internet); eCommerce (Amazon, etc.) is creating jobs, tax revenue, and growth year-over-year.  Allowing ISPs to control or alter bandwidth to an eCommerce site is the de facto death of that venture, ensuring that the company willing to pay the most to the provider will prevail.  Allowing an ISP to regulate traffic to a company’s VPN would effectively allow them to charge the company more for employee access (on top of already charging the employee for their service), again ensuring that the venture with the deepest pockets will dominate.\\n\\nI implore you: do the right thing.

Young and old, people of all backgrounds and classes flock to the internet to search for resources, news, and to communicate with their family and friends internationally. They may not have the money to pay for high-speed service provided by Verizon, which if we remove Net Neutrality laws, could be the only high-speed internet service provider - but only to the rich.\\n\\nYou see, not everyone makes six figures. Not everyone wants to, and that\\'s okay. But we need to make sure that the freest space in our society - the internet - remains open to those who don\\'t make money. In fact it should never be about money. A person\\'s value does not rest in money. Sure, it may seem like that to corporations, but ultimately if a high-paying customer gets pissed with their ISP, they will complain, and ultimately it is the customer\\'s voice that matters more than the number of dollars the person makes.\\n\\nIf companies tout this idea so loudly - the customer is always right! - then WHY does the government need to repeal laws that work in their favor? Repealing of those laws say, \"the customer\\'s voice is not as important as their worth in money\", which, if you ask companies what they think of the question, they will likely respond \"oh no the customer\\'s voice is far more important, regardless of what they pay.\"\\n\\nThe fact that those same corporations have the money to boss the government around to the point where they can lobby to get Net Neutrality thrown out of the judicial system shows how little we can trust that these people have their customer\\'s best interests in mind as people. They\\'re behind a veil of big money and connections in high places so they get more money.\\n\\nThe internet is the very entity of all that is against this kind of bull. Keep in mind not everyone has the ability to access the internet at home - many go to the library to access the internet. And if the library gets their funding cut or lessened, that means less ability to pay for better internet, which a lack of Net Neutrality would mean an extremely disabled public.\\n\\nDon\\'t take away our ability to find jobs, research our latest diagnosis, and get a break from our kids because they can play fucking agar.io for a few hours.\\n\\n(Also...don\\'t provoke the trolls.

Any restriction, prioritization, or manipulation of internet traffic by providers that affects the availability of lawful content to consumers is a detriment to the people and a violation of our rights, not to mention an assault on the core ideals the internet was founded upon.  The fundamental responsibility of internet providers is simply to open a door - it’s up to each individual to decide where to go after that.  That freedom is what grew the internet into an essential part of our daily lives, and thus put billions of dollars into the pockets of service providers.  Net neutrality MUST be upheld if current broadband providers want to continue to prosper (which they have, even after the implementation of Title II - among the three big providers of Comcast, AT&T and Verizon there\\'s been a net $3 billion increase in capex spending from 2014 to 2016, not the $3.6 billion decrease Chairman Pai claims).  The 2015 Open Internet rules reflect a history of net neutrality and provide concrete protections to ensure an open internet for the future.  Removing them, especially the Title II classification, would allow the potential of practices that would threaten or destroy open access to the internet.
